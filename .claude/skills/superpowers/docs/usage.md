Reasoning:
- Keywords detected: "React", "rendering", "performance"
- Complexity above threshold (8)
- Frontend + performance domain overlap
```

Use this to understand which agents will activate before sending message.

---

### `/sp:with` - Force Specific Agent

**Usage:**
```bash
/sp:with frontend-architect "help me design this component"
```

**What it does:**
- Forces activation of specified agent
- Bypasses automatic detection
- Useful for explicit expert consultation

---

### `/sp:config` - View/Edit Configuration

**View current config:**
```bash
/sp:config
```

**View specific section:**
```bash
/sp:config orchestration
```

**Set specific value:**
```bash
/sp:config orchestration.agentActivationThreshold 6
```

**Edit full config:**
```bash
/sp:config edit
# Opens config in editor
```

See [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for all options.

---

### `/sp:status` - System Status

**Usage:**
```bash
/sp:status
```

**Output:**
```
SupremePower Status:
- Version: 2.0.0
- Skills loaded: 14
- Agents loaded: 13
- Custom skills: 2
- Custom agents: 1
- Config path: ~/.supremepower/config.json
- MCP server: Active
- Wrapper installed: Yes
```

---

### `/sp:auto-agent-create` - Create Custom Agent

**Usage:**
```bash
/sp:auto-agent-create
```

**Interactive prompts:**
1. Agent name (e.g., "blockchain-specialist")
2. Description and expertise areas
3. Activation keywords
4. Save location

**What it does:**
- Analyzes project context
- Suggests specialization based on codebase
- Creates agent markdown file
- Registers for automatic activation

---

## Wrapper Script

The `gemini-sp` wrapper enables automatic agent orchestration.

### Basic Usage

Instead of:
```bash
gemini "your message"
```

Use:
```bash
gemini-sp "your message"
```

### How It Works

1. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Word count (default threshold: 50 words)
   - Keyword detection (technical terms)
   - Code block presence
   - Calculates complexity score

2. **Agent Selection:**
   - If complexity >= threshold, analyze for agents
   - Match keywords to agent specializations
   - Select top N agents (default: 3 max)

3. **Prompt Enhancement:**
   - Injects agent personas into system prompt
   - Preserves original user message
   - Sends enhanced prompt to Gemini CLI

4. **Fallback:**
   - If orchestration fails, passes message through unchanged
   - Logs warning but continues

### Complexity Thresholds

**Default behavior:**
- Simple queries (< 50 words, no keywords): No agents
- Medium queries (50+ words OR keywords): Automatic agents
- Complex queries (100+ words + keywords): Multiple agents

**Customize thresholds:**
```bash
/sp:config wrapper.complexity.minWordCount 30
/sp:config wrapper.complexity.requireKeywords false
```

### Examples

**Simple query - no agents:**
```bash
gemini-sp "What is JavaScript?"
# Passes through directly
```

**Medium query - agents activated:**
```bash
gemini-sp "How do I optimize React component rendering for large lists?"
# Activates: frontend-architect, performance-engineer
```

**Complex query - multiple agents:**
```bash
gemini-sp "I need to design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform \
with high availability, handling 10k requests/sec, using Node.js backends, \
React frontend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis caching. Need CI/CD pipeline too."
# Activates: system-architect, backend-architect, frontend-architect, devops-engineer
```

### Slash Command Passthrough

Slash commands automatically pass through:
```bash
gemini-sp /tdd
# Equivalent to: gemini /tdd
```

## Custom Skills and Agents

### Creating Custom Skills

**Manual creation:**

1. Create directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.supremepower/skills/my-skill
   ```

2. Create SKILL.md:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: Use when working on domain-specific task
   ---

   # My Custom Skill

   ## Workflow

   1. Step one
   2. Step two
   3. Step three

   ## Context Hints

   When working on X, consider Y and Z.

   ## Conditional Blocks

   IF user_message contains "keyword"
   THEN ACTIVATE agent-name
   CONFIDENCE high
   ```

3. Verify:
   ```bash
   /sp:status
   # Should show "Custom skills: 1"
   ```

**Using the skill:**
```bash
# If exposureMode is "commands"
/my-skill

# If exposureMode is "prompts"
gemini-sp "I need to work on X"  # Automatically loaded
```

---

### Combining with Gemini CLI Features

**Use with Gemini session context:**
```bash
gemini --context=project-docs
/plan "new feature based on docs"
```

**Use with file attachments:**
```bash
gemini --attach=src/component.tsx
gemini-sp "optimize this React component"
# Agents analyze attached code
```

---

### Tips and Best Practices

**1. Start with explicit commands, graduate to wrapper:**
- Learn skills with slash commands first
- Once familiar, use wrapper for automatic orchestration

**2. Use `/sp:analyze` to preview:**
- Before complex queries, preview agent activation
- Adjust message or config if unexpected agents activate

**3. Custom agents for repeated domains:**
- If working on same technology stack, create custom agent
- More precise activation than generic agents

**4. Adjust threshold per project:**
- Complex codebases: lower threshold (6-7)
- Simple projects: higher threshold (10-12)

**5. Combine skills:**
```bash
/brainstorm "feature X"
# Copy output
/plan "implement feature X based on brainstorm"
# Copy output
/skills:executing-plans
```

**6. Use wrapper for exploratory questions:**
```bash
gemini-sp "What's the best approach for real-time updates in React?"
# Automatic agent selection based on keywords
```

**7. Use slash commands for disciplined workflows:**
```bash
/tdd
# Forces TDD discipline
```
